# Hangman
Week 3 homework for CEP bootcamp. A simple web app in Javascript to play [Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) with the computer. Demo available at [hangman.phard.in](https://hangman.phard.in/).

## Development Notes
* While the instructions called for the game to automatically choose another word and make the user play it, I chose to allow the user to initiate a new game via a key press. This is a stylistic choice and not a technical limitation.
* The instructions also called for the creation of an "images" directory which I declined to use. The directory was created locally but left empty, and thus not commited. See [this essay](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) for some background on the design philosophy that informed this decision.
